    """
    A tool for making authenticated requests to the Luminoso API version 4.

    A LuminosoClient is a thin wrapper around the REST API documented at
    https://api.luminoso.com/v4. As such, you interact with it by calling its
    methods that correspond to HTTP methods: `.get(url)`, `.post(url)`,
    `.put(url)`, `.patch(url)`, and `.delete(url)`.

    These URLs are relative to a 'base URL' for the LuminosoClient. For
    example, you can make requests for a specific account's projects
    by creating a LuminosoClient for
    `https://api.luminoso.com/v4/projects/<account_id>`,
    or you can go deeper to create a client that makes requests for a
    specific project.

    Some methods are most useful when the client's URL refers to a project.

    These methods take parameters as keyword arguments, and encode them in
    the appropriate way for the request, which is described in the
    individual documentation for each method.

    The easiest way to create a LuminosoClient is using the
    `LuminosoClient.connect()` static method.

    In addition to the base URL, the LuminosoClient has a `root_url`,
    pointing to the root of the API, such as https://api.luminoso.com/v4.
    This is used, for example, as a starting point for the `change_path`
    method: when it gets a path starting with `/`, it will go back to the
    `root_url` instead of adding to the existing URL.
