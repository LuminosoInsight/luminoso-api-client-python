Version 0.5 (2015-12-10)

These changes correlate with moving the api from https://api.luminoso.com/v4
to https://analytics.luminoso.com/api/v4.

  * Client changes

    - Documentation updated with new URL.
    - URL_BASE updated in the constants (with API_VERSION and API_HOST being
      removed as unnecessary)
    - The logic for getting the "root url" when setting up a client is now
      different; it uses /api/v4 unless the given URL is using /v4 (in which
      case it uses /v4 but issues a warning about the new URL).

  * Upload script changes

    - Removed --local as an option, which was only usable internally.

Version 0.4.9 (2015-12-09)

  * Client changes

    - In preparation for moving the API from api.luminoso.com/v4 to
      analytics.luminoso.com/api/v4, change the logic in get_root_url to
      temporarily support the latter while still preferring the former.

Version 0.4.8 (2015-10-20)

  * Client changes

    - In upload script, use "subsets" instead of deprecated "queries".

Version 0.4.7 (2015-04-27)

  * Upload script changes

    - Add an option to specify the date format of the uploaded file.

Version 0.4.6 (2015-04-23)

  * Client changes

    - Use `ftfy.guess_bytes` instead of `chardet.detect`, which was frequently
      detecting valid UTF-8 as ISO-8859-2.

Version 0.4.5 (2015-01-23)

  * Client changes

    - Removed support for non-token authentication.
    - New `save_to_file` method allows saving API output directly to a file.
    - Removed ftfy dependency, because ftfy is now run on documents after
      they are uploaded.

Version 0.4.4 (2014-07-30)

  * Client changes

    - Upgrade dependency to python requests 1.2.1 or later, but not python
      requests 3.
    - Stop using the deprecated /preload/ endpoint.
    - Support for token authentication.
    - Remove obsolete `proxies` and `auto_login` parameters to connect().
    - Python 3 compatibility.

  * Server changes

    - Support for token authentication.

Version 0.4.3 (2013-09-13)

  * Client changes

    - Don't send "width=n" to the /preload/ endpoint, because it doesn't
      do anything.
    - Send the reader configuration given on the command line to the
      /recalculate/ endpoint.
    - Get rid of root_url as a client parameter, because nobody used it
      and it didn't actually work.

  * Server changes

    - API endpoints will now return an error when you give them unexpected
      arguments. /preload/ accepts some arguments for backward compatibility.

Version 0.4.2 (2013-07-12)

  * Update the documentation to match the changes in 0.4.1.

Version 0.4.1 (2013-07-10)

This is the first released version for the v4 Luminoso API.

  * Client changes

    - Various improvements to the lumi-upload command-line interface, which
      now is more robust for CSV uploads and has some Python 3 support.
    - Errors are more informative when login fails or when API's response
      does not contain JSON.
    - The wait_for method raises an error if the job fails.
    - Client uses the URL for the deployed v4 API.

  * Server changes

    - Various endpoint URL changes, including:
        /<account>/projects/ is now /projects/<account>/
        /.auth/login/ is now /user/login/
	/.accounts/ is now /accounts/
    - Users can have a default account, which the client can check for instead
      of arbitrarily picking one.
    - When documents are uploaded to an empty project (to be immediately
      recalculated), they should go to the /preload/ endpoint.  There is no
      longer /calculate/, only /recalculate/.


Version 0.4.0 (2013-02-21)

This is the first, preliminary version of a client that works with the Luminoso
API v4. Please note that the v4 API is *still in testing* and not yet available
for general use! This client points to a strictly internal URL.

  * Client changes

    - Several changes to the tests and documentation to take into account the
      server changes between v3 and v4.

  * Server changes

    - Project creation now assigns an arbitrary five-character ID to the
      project instead of using the specified name. (This allows more freedom in
      naming projects, which are no longer subject to length limits, character
      restrictions, or other code-internal issues.) The ID is returned upon
      project creation as "project_id" in the resulting dictionary, and that
      should be used after "projects" in URLs. See v4 documentation for more
      details.

Version 0.3.6 (2013-01-08)

  * Client changes

    - Easier way to create projects. If you don't specify a URL for the client,
      or specify the URL '/auto', it will point to the endpoint
      '/account_id/projects' for some reasonable value of 'account_id'.
      Now you just need to enter your username (and answer the password
      prompt).

  * Server changes

    - The GET /.accounts endpoint now returns a response following the standard
      format, which will give you a list of all accounts you may access.

Version 0.3.5 (2013-01-03)

  * Client changes

    - As a principled way of dealing with multiple incompatible versions of
      requests, we now depend on the 'requests-transition' distribution that
      we have put on GitHub.

      This lets us explicitly install and import version 0.x without
      conflicting with other code.

Version 0.3.4 (2013-01-02)

  * Client changes

    - The 'requests' library has made incompatible changes in version 1.0.
      As our API code is a fairly thin wrapper around requests, changing it to
      support requests 1.0 would be a major change. We'll do that in
      version 0.4.

    - The upload script now gets installed as a command called 'lumi-upload',
      which uploads properly-formatted CSV or JSON data to a project.
      Type 'lumi-upload --help' for usage information.

Version 0.3.3 (2012-11-19)

  * Client changes

    - Initial version of upload.py, a script that runs JSON or CSV data
      through the entire upload process.

Version 0.3.2 (2012-10-15)

  * Server changes

    - The API has new endpoints for uploading data in CSV format.
    - Attributes of documents can be changed without re-processing the entire
      document, using the PATCH method instead of PUT.

  * Client changes

    - Support the HTTP PATCH method.


Version 0.3.1 (2012-09-21)

This is the first published version of the client that works with the Luminoso
API v3. Significant changes since we first made it available on Git are:

  * Server changes

    - The project list (GET /v3/<account>/projects/) now returns just the
      names of the projects, not strings with your account name attached.
    - The endpoint for deleting a project is now DELETE /v3/<account>/projects,
      with a project=<projectname> parameter.
    - The API now provides .../jobs/<id> endpoints, for possibly long-running
      asynchronous tasks.
    - Running DELETE on the project URL itself will instead clear all data
      from the project, while leaving it in existence.

  * Client changes

    - PUT requests (for example, for replacing an exsiting document) work
      correctly.
    - The client has a special `wait_for` function that polls a .../jobs/<id>
      endpoint until a given task finishes. (See test.py for an example of
      using this.)
